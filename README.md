# MyPortfolio
Hey there! This is my GitHub portfolio where I've gathered some of the projects I've worked on during my master degree in "Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge" at the Alma Mater University of Bologna. These projects span a wide range of topics and applications, reflecting my journey in this field. From data analyses to interactive web tools, I hope you find something interesting here. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or collaborate. Thanks for checking it out!
